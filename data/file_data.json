    "A short warning: If you ever really got the hang of git you will not be\n",

    "disappointment** - you'll end up writing every document versioned as an\n",

    "some basic UNIX utilities or just install them with git. (Installer\n",
    "provides an option for that.) In general it's a bit like travelling with\n",
    "Vogons - avoid when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A warning for GUI users: **Don't use your GUI**. Be it the GitHub App or\n",
    "SourceTree or something else - they usually try to make things more\n",
    "abstract for us, thus they hinder us from understanding git and we can\n",
    "then not make git do what we want. Being able to communicate\n",
    "**directly** with git is a great thing and really bumps\n",
    "**productivity**!\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this tutorial to the best of my knowledge and experience, if you\n",
    "spot an error or find something important is missing, be sure to drop me\n",
    "a message!\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparation...\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "So go now, grab a cup of coffee (or any other drink), a towel, take your\n",
    "best keyboard and open a terminal beneath this window!\n",
    "\n",
    "What's Git for Anyway?\n",
    "======================\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we really get started it is important to know what git roughly\n",
    "does: git is a program that allows you to **manage files**. To be more\n",
    "specific git allows you to **define changes on files**. In the end your\n",
    "repository is just a **bunch of changes** that may be related to each\n",
    "other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting Up Git\n",
    "==============\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can continue we'll have to set up a few tiny things for git.\n",
    "For this we will use the ``git config --global`` command which simply\n",
    "**stores** a **key value pair** into your **user-global git\n",
    "configuration file** (usually stored at ``~/.gitconfig``).\n",
    "\n",
    "WHOAMI\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's tell git who we are! This is pretty straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git config --global user.name \"Ford Prefect\"\n",
    "    $ git config --global user.email ford@prefect.bg\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes git store values for \"name\" and \"email\" within the \"user\"\n",
    "section of the gitconfig.\n",
    "\n",
    "Editor\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "For some operations git will give you an **editor** so you can enter\n",
    "needed data. This editor is **vim by default**. Some people think vim is\n",
    "great (vim *is* great!), some do not. If you belong to the latter group\n",
    "or don't know what vim is and how to operate it, let's **change the\n",
    "editor**:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ # Take an editor of your choice instead of nano\n",
    "    $ git config --global core.editor nano\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure that the **command** you give to git always **starts as\n",
    "an own process** and ends only when you finished editing the file. (Some\n",
    "editors might detect running processes, pass the filename to them and\n",
    "exit immediately. Use ``-s`` argument for gedit, ``--wait`` argument for\n",
    "sublime.) Please **don't use notepad** on windows, this program is a\n",
    "perfect example of a text editor which is too dumb to show text unless\n",
    "the text is written by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Repository\n",
    "===================\n",
    "\n",
    "So, lets get started - with nothing. Let's make an empty directory. You\n",
    "can do that from your usual terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ mkdir git-tutorial\n",
    "    $ cd git-tutorial\n",
    "    $ ls -a\n",
    "    ./  ../\n",
    "\n",
    "So, lets do the first git command here:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git init\n",
    "    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/lasse/prog/git-tutorial/.git/\n",
    "    $ ls -a\n",
    "    ./  ../  .git/\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we've got the ``.git`` folder. Since we just created a repository\n",
    "with ``git init``, so we can deduce, that this **.git directory must in\n",
    "fact be the repository**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a God Commit\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's create some content we can manage with git:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ echo 'Hello World!' >> README\n",
    "    $ cat README\n",
    "    Hello World!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know, that the .git directory is our repository, we also know\n",
    "that **we did not add this file to our repository** yet. So how do we do\n",
    "that?\n",
    "\n",
    "As I've hinted before, our git repository **does not contain files** but\n",
    "only **changes** - so how do we make a change out of our file?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer lies in (1) ``git add`` and (2) ``git commit`` which allows us\n",
    "to (1) specify what files/file changes we want to add to the change and\n",
    "(2) that we want to pack those file changes into a so-called **commit**.\n",
    "Git also offers a helper command so we can see what will be added to our\n",
    "commit: ``git status``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it out:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git status\n",
    "    On branch master\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initial commit\n",
    "\n",
    "    Untracked files:\n",
    "      (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "\n",
    "        README\n",
    "\n",
    "    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "    $ git add README\n",
    "    $ git status\n",
    "    On branch master\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initial commit\n",
    "\n",
    "    Changes to be committed:\n",
    "      (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage)\n",
    "\n",
    "        new file:   README\n",
    "\n",
    "So obviously with ``git add`` we can **stage** files. What does that\n",
    "mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, when we're working in our directory **any actions on files\n",
    "won't affect our repository**. So in order to **add a file** to the\n",
    "repository, we'll have to **put it into a commit**. In order to do that,\n",
    "we need to **specify, what files/changes should go into our commit**,\n",
    "i.e. stage them. When we did ``git add README``, we **staged** the file\n",
    "README, thus every change we did until now to it will be **included in\n",
    "our next commit**. (You can also partially stage files so if you edit\n",
    "README now the change won't be committed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll do something very special in git - **creating the first\n",
    "commit**! (We'll pass the ``-v`` argument to get a bit more info from\n",
    "git on what we're doing.)\n",
    "\n",

    "In order to generally **ignore certain patterns** of files (e.g. it's\n",

    "-  Not be added with ``git add`` unless forced with ``-f``\n",
    "-  Not be shown in ``git status`` as unstaged\n",
    "\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "==========\n",
    "\n",
    "So what did we learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "We did some basic git commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  ``git config``: accessing git configuration\n",
    "-  ``git init``: creating a repository\n",
    "-  ``git status``: getting the current status of files, staging and so on\n",
    "-  ``git add``: staging files for the commit\n",
    "-  ``git diff``: showing the difference between the current commit and\n",
    "   what we have on our file system\n",
    "-  ``git commit``: writing staged changes to a commit\n",
    "-  ``git log``: browsing history\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned how git organizes commits, how it stores files and how\n",
    "we can make git ignore files explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this helped you **understanding** a bit **what git does** and\n",
    "**what it is**. The next tutorial will hopefully cover all the basics.\n",

    "\ufeffcoala Installation\n",
    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "This document contains information on how to install *coala*. Supported\n",
    "platforms are Linux and Windows. *coala* is known to work on OS X as well.\n",
    "*coala* is tested against CPython 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run *coala* you need to install Python. It is recommended,\n",
    "that you install Python3 >= 3.3 from http://www.python.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to install *coala* is using pip (Pip Installs Packages).\n",
    "If you don't already have pip, you can install it like described on\n",
    "https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing.html. Note that pip is shipped\n",
    "with recent python versions by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "System wide installation\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to install *coala* is to do it system-wide. But, This is\n",
    "generally discouraged in favor or using a virtualenv.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the latest most stable version of *coala* and supported bears\n",
    "system-wide, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install coala-bears\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "\n",
    "    For this and all future steps, some steps require root access\n",
    "    (also known as administrative privileges in Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Unix based** (Mac, Linux) - This can be achieved by using ``sudo``\n",
    "    in front of the command ``sudo command_name`` instead of\n",
    "    ``command_name``\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Windows** - The easiest way on windows is to start a\n",
    "    command prompt as an administrator and start ``setup.py``.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the nightly build from our master branch, you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install coala-bears --pre\n",
    "\n",
    "To install only *coala* (without any bears), you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install coala\n",
    "\n",
    "With ``--pre`` you can install the nightly build of the *coala* base\n",
    "without bears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing inside a virtualenv\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtualenv is probably what you want to use during development,\n",
    "you\u2019ll probably want to use it there, too. You can read more about\n",
    "it at their documentation - http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to install virtualenv to the system. This can be done\n",
    "with ``pip3`` easily:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have virtualenv installed, just fire up a shell and create\n",
    "your own environment. I usually create a project folder and a ``venv``\n",
    "folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ virtualenv venv\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, whenever you want to work on the project, you only have to activate\n",
    "the corresponding environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    On **Unix based** systems (OSX and Linux) this can be done with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ::\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "\n",
    "    And on **Windows** this is done with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ::\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ venv\\scripts\\activate\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you install *coala* and supported bears inside the activated\n",
    "virtualenv with:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install coala-bears\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing coala from source\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to install *coala* from source, it is recommended to install git.\n",
    "See http://git-scm.com/ for further information and a downloadable\n",
    "installer or use your package manager on linux to get it.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "\n",
    "    Again, here it is recommended to install *coala* inside a virtualenv.\n",
    "    This can be done by creating a virtualenv and running the installation\n",
    "    commands after the virtualenv has been activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "After having git installed, you can download the source code of *coala*\n",
    "with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git clone https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-bears/\n",
    "    $ cd coala-bears\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now install *coala* with a simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python3 setup.py install\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above to work, you may also need to install `setuptools` which can be\n",
    "installed by running\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install setuptools\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have *coala* installed into your python scripts directory. On an\n",
    "unixoid system it is probably already available on your command line\n",
    "globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also install a development version of *coala* to test and make\n",
    "changes easily. To do this run:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python3 setup.py develop\n",
    "\n",
    "This essentially lets you install *coala* in a way that allows you to make\n",
    "changes to the code and see the changes take effect immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternate installation\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to install coala to an alternate location you can e.g. call\n",
    "``python3 setup.py install --prefix=/your/prefix/location``. Other\n",
    "options are documented on\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3.3/install/#alternate-installation.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you are using a proxy, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -  Set up your system-wide proxy.\n",
    "    -  Use ``sudo -E pip3 install coala`` (the ``-E`` flag takes the\n",
    "       existing environment variables into the ``sudo`` environment).\n",

    "In case you are getting\n",
    "``ValueError:('Expected version spec in', 'appdirs ~=1.4.0', 'at', ' ~=1.4.0')``\n",
    "then don't panic. It happens when you are using an outdated version of pip\n",
    "that doesn't support our version specifiers yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ideally, you have to create a virtual environment with a newer pip:\n",

    "    This tutorial is about using Git in bash/cmd, which we highly recommend,\n",
    "    as it's cleaner.\n",
    "    Github is a totally different thing, it is the web interface or app.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to install Git\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "First step is installing Git. Supposing you are on a Debian based distribution,\n",
    "this will do:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ sudo apt-get install git-all\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting started with coala\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, you have to fork the repository you are going to contribute to.\n",
    "This will basically give you a clone of the repository to your own repository.\n",
    "You can do this by opening `this to fork the *coala* website <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala>`_\n",
    "or `this to fork the *coala-bears* website <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-bears>`_\n",
    "and then clicking 'Fork' in the upper right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grabbing coala on your local machine\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should clone the repository to your local machine so that you can have\n",
    "access to all the code and start fixing issues!\n",
    "To do this, you can use these to clone the *coala* / *coala-bears* repositories:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git clone https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git clone https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-bears\n",
    "\n",
    "You should ideally clone the fork so that gets set to 'origin' automatically.\n",
    "Now you have all your code on your local machine!\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting to work\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's talk about remotes. To communicate with the outside world, git uses\n",
    "what are called remotes. These are repositories other than the one on your local\n",
    "disk which you can push your changes into (so that other people can see them) or\n",
    "pull from (so that you can get others changes).\n",
    "Now you should add a remote to your local machine so that you can ``pull`` and\n",
    "``push`` your commits. This can be simply done by using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git remote add myfork <your_fork_link>\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",

    "  name it however you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new branch\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working on an issue, you first need to create a new branch where you\n",
    "will work.\n",

    "\n",
    "    $ git checkout -b branchname\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``checkout`` will switch to the newly created branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``-b`` will create a new branch if the branch doesn't already exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking your work\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "After the issue is fixed and you have tested it (tests are very important!\n",
    "never submit a change that isn't tested), you should check your progress. Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git status\n",
    "\n",
    "It will give you an idea about what files are currently modified.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tip: If there's something you don't find, you can always use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``$ git grep \"syntax\"``\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will search through the whole repository and show you the files\n",
    "    that contain the syntax.\n",

    "Adding the files and commiting\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can add your files/folders to the current commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git add <file/folder_name>\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this until you have added all the files needed for your commit.\n",
    "Then type:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git commit\n",
    "\n",
    "This will lead you to a text editor. Now you need to write your commit message.\n",

    "- **The header**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The header should have the name of the file that you have made the change on,\n",

    "  Its maximum length is 50 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The issue that is being fixed**\n",

    "Welcome. This tutorial aims to show you how to use the ``@linter`` decorator in\n",

    "Why is This Useful?\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of programming languages already have linters implemented, so if your\n",
    "project uses a language that does not already have a linter Bear you might\n",
    "need to implement it on your own. Don't worry, it's easy!\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we Need?\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need the linter executable that we are going to use.\n",
    "In this tutorial we will build the PylintTutorialBear so we need Pylint, a\n",
    "common linter for Python. It can be found `here <https://www.pylint.org/>`__.\n",

    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install pylint\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing the Bear\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a linter bear, we need to create a class that interfaces with our\n",
    "linter-bear infrastructure, that is provided via the ``@linter`` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    from coalib.bearlib.abstractions.Linter import linter\n",
    "\n",
    "    @linter(executable='pylint')\n",
    "    class PylintTutorialBear:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see ``pylint`` is already provided as an executable name which gets\n",
    "invoked on the files you are going to lint. This is a mandatory argument for\n",
    "the decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linter class is only capable of processing one file at a time, for this\n",
    "purpose ``pylint`` or the external tool needs to be invoked every time with the\n",
    "appropriate parameters. This is done inside ``create_arguments``,\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    @linter(executable='pylint')\n",

    "            pass\n",
    "\n",
    "``create_arguments`` accepts three parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``filename``: The absolute path to the file that gets processed.\n",
    "- ``file``: The contents of the file to process, given as a list of lines\n",
    "  (including the return character).\n",
    "- ``config_file``: The absolute path to a config file to use. If no config file\n",
    "  is used, this parameter is ``None``. More on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use these parameters to construct the command line arguments. The\n",
    "linter expects from you to return an argument sequence here. A tuple is\n",
    "preferred. We will do this soon for ``PylintTutorialBear``.\n",
    "\n",
    "So which are the exact command line arguments we need to provide? It depends on\n",
    "the output format of the linter. The ``@linter`` decorator is capable of\n",
    "handling different output formats:\n",
    "\n",

    "- ``corrected``: Auto-generates results from a fixed/corrected file provided by\n",
    "  the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to use the ``regex`` output format. But before we\n",

    "contributors.\n",

    "-------------------\n",

    "    [TODOS]\n",
    "    bears = KeywordBear\n",
    "\n",
    "And execute ``coala`` with the ``-s`` argument which is the same as\n",

    "After the results we've already seen, we'll see a new informational one\n",
    "which informs us that we have a TODO in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you note that we didn't specify which files to check this time? This\n",
    "is because all settings, including ``files = src/*.c``, from the Default\n",
    "section are already available in every other section implicitly. Thus\n",
    "the default section is a good point to set things like logging and\n",
    "output settings or specifying a default set of files to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring Issues\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to ignore certain issues, so you aren't lost if\n",
    "any routines yield false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring Files\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "*coala* lets you ignore whole files through the ``ignore`` setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    files = **/*.h\n",
    "    ignore = **/resources.h\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration would include all header (``.h``) files but leaves\n",
    "out resource headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring code Inside Files\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need finer-graded ignores. Imagine you have a\n",
    "``LineLengthBear`` that shall not run on some code segments, because you\n",
    "can't wrap them:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    code = \"that's checked normally\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Ignore LineLengthBear\n",
    "    unwrappable_string = \"some string that is long and would exceed the limit\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also skip an area:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Start ignoring LineLengthBear\n",
    "    unwrappable_string_2 = unwrappable_string + \"yeah it goes even further...\"\n",
    "    another_unwrappable_string = unwrappable_string + unwrappable_string_2\n",
    "    # Stop ignoring\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also conditionally combine ignore rules! Bear names will be\n",
    "split by comma and spaces, invalid bear names like ``and`` will be\n",
    "ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that in the bear names delimited by commas and spaces, you may\n",
    "specify glob wildcards that match several bears:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Start ignoring Line*, Py*\n",
    "    unwrappable_string_2 = unwrappable_string + \"yeah it goes even further...\"\n",
    "    another_unwrappable_string = unwrappable_string + unwrappable_string_2\n",
    "    # Stop ignoring\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example all bears matching the glob `Line*` and `Py*` will\n",
    "be ignored. You may also specify more complex globs here such as\n",
    "`# Start ignoring (Line*|P[yx]*)` which will ignore all bears start with\n",
    "`Line`, `Py`, and `Px`.\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",

    "those lines will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling/Disabling Sections\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have sections we need some way to control, which sections\n",
    "are executed. *coala* provides two ways to do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Enabling/Disabling\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add the line ``TODOS.enabled=False`` to some arbitrary place to\n",
    "your ``.coafile`` or just ``enabled=False`` into the ``TODOS`` section,\n",
    "*coala* will not show the TODOs on every run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially for those bears yielding informational messages which you\n",
    "might want to see from time to time this is a good way to silence them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying Targets\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "If you provide positional arguments, like ``coala Makefiles``, *coala*\n",
    "will execute exclusively those sections that are specified. This will\n",
    "not get stored in your ``.coafile`` and will take precedence over all\n",
    "enabled settings. You can specify several targets seperated by a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "What was that TODO again?\n",
    "\n",
    "Show bears' information\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "::\n",

    "The .coafile Specification\n",
    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "This document gives a short introduction into the specification of a\n",
    "*coala* configuration file. It is meant to be rather factual, if you wish\n",
    "to learn by example, please take a look at the :doc:`Tutorials/Tutorial`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming, Scope and Location\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use up to three coafiles to configure your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A project-wide coafile.\n",
    "2. A user-wide coafile.\n",
    "3. A system-wide coafile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project-Wide coafile\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a convention that the project-wide coafile is named ``.coafile``\n",
    "and lies in the project root directory. If you follow this convention,\n",
    "simply executing ``coala`` from the project root will execute the\n",
    "configuration specified in that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Settings given in the project-wide coafile override all settings given\n",
    "by other files and can only be overridden by settings given via the\n",
    "command line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-Wide and System-Wide coafile\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "You can place a ``.coarc`` file in your home directory to set certain\n",
    "settings user wide. Those settings will automatically be taken for all\n",
    "projects executed with that user.\n",
    "\n",
    "All settings specified here override only settings given by the system\n",
    "wide coafile which has the lowest priority. The ``default_coafile`` must\n",
    "lie in the *coala* installation directory and is valid for everyone using\n",
    "this *coala* installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting Inheritance\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Every coafile consists out of one or more sections. Section names are\n",
    "case insensitive. The ``default`` section is implicitly available and\n",
    "all settings which have no section specified belong to it. The\n",
    "``default`` section is special because all settings residing in it are\n",
    "automatically inherited to all other sections specified in the same\n",
    "coafile.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example coafile:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    enabled = True\n",
    "    overridable = 2\n",
    "\n",

    "    overridable = 3\n",
    "    other = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "    [section-2]\n",
    "    overridable = 5\n",
    "    other = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This coafile would be interpreted the very same as this one, written a\n",
    "bit more explicitly:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    [default]\n",
    "    enabled = True\n",

    "    enabled = True\n",
    "    overridable = 5\n",
    "    other = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments, Escaping and Multiline Values and Keys\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are simply done with a preceding ``#``. If you want to use a\n",
    "``#`` within a value, you can simply escape it:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    a_key = a\\#value # And a comment at the end!\n",
    "\n",

    "value of the last key:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    a_key = a\n",
    "    value\n",
    "    # this is not part of the value\n",
    "    that /= is\n",
    "    very long!\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, you can also set a value to multiple keys:\n",
    "``key_1, key_2 = value`` is equivalent to ``key_1 = value`` and\n",
    "``key_2 = value`` in separate lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the backslash is the escape character it is recommended to use\n",
    "forward slashes as path seperator even on windows (to keep relative\n",
    "paths platform independent), use double-backslashes if you really mean a\n",
    "backslash in all places.\n"
